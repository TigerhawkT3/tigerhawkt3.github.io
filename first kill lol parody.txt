The first match I filled was a promo in ranked
And a Bronze locked in ADC
The rest of our comp Silver and Gold
And then I waited, watching them lock.

When First Blood I spilled (I don't know how to Bard)
So mad the carry was; he raged
Finding fault with my plan, ploy to take his gold
He swore my MMR would fade.

Breaking up our pair, he could solo farm
Claiming maxing Silver Bolts was good
I muted all his noise, and saw pleas from Vlad
To gank for his lane if I could.

I think we'll lose fast
Quickly pwned
I'm a lone champ without gold.

I can feed Kog'Maw
On my own
Until Blue team has won.

Sensing gold, mid joins the fight, Tides of Blood primed for the cast
A Vision Ward my only sight, never heard advice so crass
Ignore these vile worms, /all chat is safe to spurn
So tell me of their nonsense memes: I cannot fathom what it means.

Didn't bother crazy Kled, he hooked their Shen for me
Didn't know that a wall procced my stun
Then monsters of the Void, chasing me with Brand
Tried to seal my fate and end my fun.

I think we'll lose fast
Quickly pwned
I'm a lone champ without gold.

I can feed Kog'Maw
On my own
Until Blue team has won.
