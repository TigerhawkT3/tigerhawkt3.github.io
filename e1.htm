<p>Fenix E1</p>
<p>The E1 is a slightly beefier predecessor to the <a href="e0.htm">E0</a>. It has the same body as the L0P, but its output is somewhere between that of the L0P and the E0. It uses a Nichia &quot;Power LED,&quot; which gives it a brighter, whiter, throwier, and more ringy beam than the E0, with a shorter runtime as well. At 0.18A on a 1.75V Energizer L92 AAA lithium cell (0.315W) , it should have about half the runtime of the E0 on the same cell.</p>

<p>The E1 may be larger than the E0, but not by much.</p>

<p>The E1 has an actual chromed reflector and a glass lens.</p>

<p>The E1 has a notch in its tail just like the E0, so it too can tailstand.</p>

<p>I bought this light with the E0, but I've found that I haven't used it at all. I think it's because if I want more output, I want MUCH more output, so I'll choose a bigger light.</p>
