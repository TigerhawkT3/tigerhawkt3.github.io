[Chorus A:
Lol lol, lol lol, lol
Mana up.
Lol lol, lol lol, lol
The priests are Fading.]

[Chorus B:
My tank skills bring all the nubs to the yard,
And my block is higher than yours,
Death Knights? They wish they had ours,
Blizz could fix them, but they'd have to charge.]

[Full Chorus: AABB]

B
B

They know I've got it
My gear is plate, see?
What the guilds have spots free for
They move from fire,
They pray I'll find
Some extra time.

Full Chorus

They think they'll get carried
They think I'll spout leet speak
"Control, Delete, with Alt"
Their toons were bought
China bots? Not smart.
Research and thought.

Full Chorus

Oh, once you start the pull
All the deeps will pop Deathwish, so
Just focus on your bars
And kite the boss from void zones
Just build up Vengeance and
Use your threat rotation
Shield Slam the boss's knee
With Holy Power three.
