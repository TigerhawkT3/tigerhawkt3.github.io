<p>Streamlight TL-3</p>
<p>The TL-3 is a 3xCR213A xenon light. It isn't too spectacular at first glance, but it really is a nice light. It's really bright, it's focusable, and it's tough. It's all wrapped up in an attractive, durable package that can easily fit in a pocket. Another benefit of this light is that it's easily customizable.</p>

<p>The included lanyard has a pair of adjustable stops, and it attaches to the light's belt clip (not visible in the above picture).</p>
<p>The TL-3 has really nice output with few  rings or dark spots, as the textured reflector blends it into a reasonably even spot, with a noticable hotspot at tight focus and a slightly darker center at wide focus.</p>

<p>That orange ring around the bulb is part of the light, not an illusion.</p>
<p>The TL-3 uses a tactical-type twist-constant/push-momentary tailswitch, but it can't be locked out. Untwisting the tailcap just makes for a longer throw with momentary and more required twisting for constant. Oh well.</p>

<p>The light consists of a bezel assembly, bezel spring, LA, body, belt clip, cells, and tailcap. In the following picture, you can see how the lanyard's split ring connects to a raised attachment point on the belt clip.</p>

<p>Below is the bezel and LA. To disassemble:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Remove the head by untwisting.</li>
  <li>Separate the bezel spring from the bezel and/or LA by twisting CLOCKWISE. It's a spring, not a thread, and springs are weird that way.</li>
  <li>Grasp the bulb's glass envelope with gloved hands or a clean, dry cloth, and pull it straight out of the bulb holder. If you touch the bulb with your bare hands, lightly clean it with some rubbing alcohol.</li>
  <li>Reverse these instructions to reassemble.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can replace your bulb when it has burned out, or you can use a Carley 1499 xenon bulb or halogen-filled H1499 for much more output (keep in mind, though, that the human eye is logarithmic!). My TL-3 pictured here has a standard 1499, not a halogen H1499 nor a stock TL-3 bulb.</p>

<p>If you want, you can power this light with a pair of 17500 Li-Ions for guilt-free lumens. You'll get pretty much the same brightness as with 3xCR123A.</p>
<p>This light (with a 1499, remember) pulls 1.77A at 8.8V on primaries, for 15.576W of power consumption. On Li-Ions, it pulls 1.9A at 8.3V, for 15.77W of power consumption.</p>
<p>All in all, this is a really nice light. It's one of only three incandescents I own, and the only one I'd actually consider carrying and using. If you want a small, tough, no-frills hotwire for about $50, this is the light for you.</p>
