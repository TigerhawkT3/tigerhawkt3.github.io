<p>Black 2D Mag-Lite</p>
<p>It's a Mag.</p>
<p>2D is a pretty nice size.</p>
<p><img src="images/mag2d1.jpg" width="854" height="523" /></p>
<p>As you can see in the photo below, this Mag has a Nite-Ize LED upgrade, providing extremely long runtime. These modules are bright enough for indoor use and can adapt to any voltage between one and nine volts. </p>

<p>That tailspring is pretty stiff, making battery changes a real chore.</p>
<p>Current draw is 0.18A at 2.6V for 0.468W. </p>
<p>The Nite-Ize PR LED can be found at many retail stores for less than $10. Get one. In fact, get a few, because you'll probably find even more places to put one. </p>
