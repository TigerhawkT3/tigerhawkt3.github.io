<p>Black 4D Mag-Lite</p>
<p>It's a Mag. 4D is a bit long, but it's still within reason.</p>
<p><img src="images/black4dmag1.jpg" width="270" height="497" /></p>
<p>This particular 4D Mag was purchased with a MagLED module installed. There is an enormous amount of information available on these things, so I'll be brief:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They're bright</li>
  <li>They're very focusable for throw</li>
  <li>They still leave a donut at wide focus</li>
  <li>Thermal throttling cuts output in half within ten minutes</li>
  <li>They only come in 2-, 3-, and 4-cell varieties</li>
  <li>You MUST use the listed number of cells for each module</li>
  <li>They're too wide to fit in any PR light except Mags </li>
  <li>Runtime is fabulous</li>
  <li>These are available at many common retail stores</li>
</ul>
<p>Below, you can see the Mag body with a D cell poking out, the tailcap, the tailspring, the MagLED emitter module, the bulb collar ring, the head, the reflector, the window, the bezel, and a belt loop ring holster. The ring holsters are sold separately.</p>

<p>It pulls 0.75A at 5.2V, for 3.9W of power consumption.</p>
<p>Once again, it's a Mag. The MagLED module is much better than the stock Krypton bulb.</p>
