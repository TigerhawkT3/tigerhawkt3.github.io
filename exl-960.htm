<p>Adjustable Buzzer EXL-960</p>
<p>(Saftey first! Wear ear protection when working with noise.)</p>
<p>This is a buzzer. It makes noise. It's not nearly as frightening as an <a href="hfairhorn.htm">air horn</a>, but it's really, really unpleasant to be around. It makes a beep sound as long as there's current going through it.</p>

<p>As you can see, it's actually a pretty large buzzer.This buzzer has a nifty little feature that you can see here:</p>

<p>All you have to do is slightly loosen that screw, and you can slide the covering back and forth. Pretty nifty, if you don't have some sort of <a href="http://store.qkits.com/moreinfo.cfm/FK808">voltage regulator</a>.</p>
<p>These buzzers are really cheap, like a buck or two. They're fun to mess around with.</p>
