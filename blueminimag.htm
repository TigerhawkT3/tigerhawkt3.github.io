<p>Blue Mini-Mag-Lite</p>
<p>This is the quintessential loaner light. The host Minimag was given to me by a buddy when we were cleaning out his Public Storage space, the batteries ZTSed at less than 60% and my work was going to throw them away, and the LA is a cheapo Nite-Ize. (Yes, I convinced my workplace to buy a real tester instead of a $2 analog voltmeter.) </p>

<p>The NI module is a direct replacement for the classic Minimag stock lamp. It's three 5mm LEDs (mine are white, but they're available in many colors) and a little black dot that seems to serve the same function as the human appendix: none. This module can be purchased separately or packaged with a tail clickie. The combo is  an extra fifty cents, bringing the total up to a whopping $8.50. It's a good clickie, too, because although it can't tailstand, it's a forward-clickie and it's more compact and reliable than the Kroll.</p>

<p>The beam is more than enough for navigation, with a bluish, unfocusable flood. Keep in mind that the actual blue module is much bluer. Battery life is amazing, as well. Just slap in a couple alks and forget about it.</p>

<p>This light pulls 0.21A at 2.3V, for power consumption of 0.483W.</p>
<p>If you have a spare Minimag sitting around, put a NI in it. It's handy and really inexpensive. </p>
