<p>Inova Radiant 2AAA</p>
<p>This light is one of Inova's stripped-down-unplugged models, with most of the features and quality found in their better (more expensive) lights.</p>

<p>As you can see in the picture below, the switch is not protected. If you drop it on its tailcap, the switch WILL activate, possibly leaving you in the dark. This also makes it unable to tailstand. However, it is resistant to rolling because of its flat sides.</p>

<p>I don't know if I would trust this light in a wet environment because of the vents at the head.</p>
<p>The beam has a blue hotspot and green corona. The corona's green tint carries over into the spill. </p>
<p>The head is nonremovable, and the tailcap has a stop built in so that everything lines up neatly when the light is closed up. The batteries go in NEGATIVE FIRST. This is indicated by the little positive terminal in the tailcap with a &quot;+&quot; sign on it. </p>

<p>This light pulls 0.13A at 2V, consuming 0.26W. </p>
<p>This is a nice little all-purpose light, but there are much better AAA offerings available. On the plus side, this light is less than fifteen bucks and can be found at retail stores. </p>
