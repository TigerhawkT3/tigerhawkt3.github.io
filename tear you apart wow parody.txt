He's a green man, he eats swine, talks with his knife
He's a guild leader, big time, raiding tonight
Tells and whispers or guild mail, sending invites
Wanna help out and give us Blessing of Might?

Raid night is coming, spam to the guild
"Tell your friend list," he begs them, feeling no guilt
But the roster's inflated, now it's flush with bytes
Though he checked it before class, meager, now tight.

It's cool, in a way, 'til you think and see
And you know you have some work ahead, you're in deep
Escape was just a "lawl" and a "c u all lates"
A mess he's gotten into with his needy ways.

It's only just a raid, they won't care anyway
It's just like any other, there'll be other days
Or maybe they'll be raging and you'd best not show
A raid during the day is serious business, you know.

Chorus:[I want to down that boss
Have some efficient fights
Countdown, prepot boss pull
We'll get the mechanics right.

I want to down that boss
Debuffs, melees hard
From my mic to all your ears
I'll blast tonight's performance apart.]

So he logged on and told them, thinking they'd understand
And they bitched and moaned to trade a lot, he stood no chance
The "Band of Merry Men" guild messaged him there
Told him this was trifling and he shouldn't care.

He messaged them back, talked about it, asked what they'd do
'Cause there's always some dumb person when you're planning a raid
Thinks they're so pro, just such a genius, making their plans
They may be their server's Patton, or they may just suck ass.

Either way he needed help to lead this raid
He wanted phat loots, epics, purples, call them what you will
Now with just a click, they show what they hide
Those fancy titles show that they are pro; they'll help him.

[Chorus] x3
