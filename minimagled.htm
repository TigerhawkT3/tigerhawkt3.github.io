<p>MiniMagLED 2AA/3AA</p>
<p>I'm going to be lazy and put two lights into a single review, but there's a good reason: the only difference between the pair is added length for an extra cell.</p>
<p>I couldn't restrain myself, and recently ordered two MiniMagLEDs from Lighthound, one in 2AA, the other in 3AA. No surprises - the focusing actually works (unlike the incan models), the output and runtime are both quite decent (again, unlike the incan models), and there are a few slight differences from the original MiniMag. The head of the LED version is slightly longer, the tailcap dispenses with the lanyard attachment point, the reflector is optimized for a LuxIII instead of an incan &quot;rice bulb,&quot; and the entire tailcap has been completely redesigned. Most aftermarket accessories should still fit, but tailcaps meant for the original MiniMag will need their springs stretched a bit to mimic the larger MiniMag LED tailcap.</p>
<p>The picture immediately below is the 2AA version, and the one below that is the 3AA.</p>

<p>The disassembled light below is the 2AA, and the one below that is the 3AA.</p>

<p>The LA and tailcap are the same for both lights. The driver electronics are different, though, to properly use two or three alkaline cells.</p>

<p>The 2AA version runs at 2.4V, 0.46A, 1.104W, and the 3AA runs at 3.9V, 0.65A, 2.535W.</p>
<p>Overall, these are mediocre lights when compared to the many stellar performers already available. Compared to the stock, original incan MiniMag, however, these lights are a no-brainer, offering the benefits of LED versus incan in a familiar package. Hopefully, the ordinary consumer will go for these instead of the incan version.</p>
