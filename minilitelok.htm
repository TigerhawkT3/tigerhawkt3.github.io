<p>The Mini Lite-Lok (MLL) holds a Minimag or similar-diameter AA light. It's a belt clip with a U-shaped holder mounted on a detented swivel. It has 16 solid positions, and the light is released by a little tab that, when pushed, widens the U.</p>
<p>I got three of these to hold my L2D-CEs and L1D-CE. I also made some nylon straps that can hold MLLs on a wrist, neck, or head. The L2D-CEs fit, but were loose until I added six layers of electrical tape. The L1D-CE doesn't fit at all. It's really too bad, because these are excellent holsters! You can hold a AA light bezel-up or bezel-down, and you don't even have to remove it to direct light where you want it! It's easy to pop it out, though, if you need to handhold it.</p>

<p>Overall, I'm really happy with these... I just wish the L1D-CE fit into them.</p>
