<p>Streamlight Scorpion LED</p>
<p>I must admit, I didn't expect much out of the Scorpion LED. It's a 2xCR123A LuxIII light. Nothing special, right?</p>
<p>Happily, I was unexpectedly impressed by this light!</p>

<p>The Scorpion LED is an aluminum light, with a rubber sleeve around the body. This is welcome news for grip, and if you've ever held a metal light that's been out in the cold for a while, you know that it'll also keep your fingers from falling off when you pick up the light.</p>

<p>In the above picture, you can see the body on the left, with Streamlight's included cells poking out, followed by the light's &quot;neck&quot; (?), then the LA, and then the bezel. That silvery retaining ring has holes for unscrewing, but it doesn't come out. Seriously.</p>
<p>Here's where all the magic happens: the head!</p>

<p>As you can plainly see, the Scorpion LED sports a half-stipple, half-smooth reflector that results in one of the most beautiful beams I've ever seen. How good is it? &quot;<a href="poopmpants.mp3">Poopmpants</a>&quot; good. Yes, that good. It has a perfectly round hotspot, with a perfect-sized, perfectly round, artifact-free corona, and generous sidespill. The three components are each plainly present, but the transition between levels is creamy smooth. Dang, this beam is amazing.</p>
<p>You can also see the flat facets around the head. These provide good anti-roll.</p>
<p>The switch is a forward-clickie in the tail. It's covered by the body's rubber sleeve.</p>

<p>All in all, this light is like a &quot;deluxe&quot; version of the SLPPL4AA. It's smaller, with a better beam, aluminum and rubber, and more stylish to boot. It doesn't have quite the runtime, but it's still good, at 2.5 hours (tested by Quickbeam). I really, really like this light.</p>
