<p>Streamlight ProPolymer 4AA Luxeon</p>
<p>This light is the very embodiment of solid, tough reliability. Its plastic housing isn't ordinary plastic, but rather a high-impact polymer. Drop a plastic 2D incan light on the floor, and it'll probably crack. Drop a ProPoly from a few stories up, and it'll suffer no damage.</p>

<p>Its spot is a very no-frills deal: There's a tight hotspot, mildly artifacted corona, and nice spillbeam. This is less of a general area illuminator and more of a spot interest illuminator. Use it to pick out landmarks while hiking, inspect trouble spots on a construction site, or show off to your friends during the next power outage.</p>
<p>The switch is in the back of the light. This encourages the over-the-shoulder hold, where the user keeps the light near eye level, as opposed to a side-switch light that is meant to be held at waist level.</p>

<p>The light has a bezel shroud with plastic window, reflector/emitter assembly, batteries, and body. The rear switch area of the light does not detach.</p>

<p>The light pulls 0.5A at 5V, consuming 2.5W.</p>
<p>This excellent light is even better when you consider its low price of less than $30.  </p>
