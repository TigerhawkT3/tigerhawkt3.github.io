<p>Black 4C Mag-Lite Number 2</p>
<p>This is no ordinay Mag. Most people would expect a swirly, slightly yellowish beam to come out the head... until they saw its head, that is!</p>
<p><img src="images/noisemag1.jpg" width="748" height="278" /></p>
<p>The above picture is the initial build of my noise mods. That's right; each of these freaklights emits a high-pitched tone instead of light. This review covers the one on the left in the above photo. It uses a <a href="superbuzzer.htm">super buzzer</a>.</p>
<p>In the next two photos, you can see the construction of this type of mod. With the help of a friend, I broke the glass envelopes of the stock Krypton bulbs, passed the buzzer leads through the bulb retaining collar, and soldered the positive and negative wires to the proper areas. You can then simply put the PR base into the bulb socket as usual, tighten the bulb retaining collar as usual, and reassemble the head (these buzzers are large, so you have to remove the bezel and window before installing the PR base).</p>

<p>In their initial form, a &quot;light&quot; like this loses output behind the window, since although the plastic may be transparent to light, the environmental sealing blocks a lot of the sound. This brings us to the next iteration:</p>

<p>With the help of a friend, I drilled a hole as close to the center of each window as possible. I used a half-inch twist bit. This change allows MUCH more sound to be transmitted.</p>
<p>This particular (black-buzzer) mod puts out 100dB at one meter, which is approximately equivalent to a jackhammer at 2 meters. It's really painfully loud.</p>
<p>Of course, I didn't think it was loud enough.</p>
<p><img src="images/noisemag5.jpg" width="479" height="508" /></p>
<p>This adds about 5dB.</p>
<p>With the power supply pictured below...</p>
<p><img src="images/noisemag8.jpg" width="972" height="211" /></p>
<p>...this mod uses only 36mA at 18.3V. That's just 0.6588W! This setup should have about 35 hours of runtime.</p>
<p>This mod is simply awesome. It's crazy loud, has a pretty good pitch (deeper than the <a href="black4cmag1.htm">other one</a>), and the buzzer is larger and black, so it even looks better!</p>
<p>These things are dirt cheap, too. The most expensive part by far is the Mag, which wasn't very expensive.</p>
