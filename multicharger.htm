<p>Universal Smart Charger</p>
<p>This charger can charge anywhere from 5-10 NiCad or NiMH battery packs (that's 6-12V, by the way). Use one of the many included connectors as shown in the image below, or just use the alligator clips.</p>

<p>Yes, that power cord is the same as the one that powers your PC, monitor, printer, etc.</p>
<p>I use this to charge the NiMH packs in my <a href="lk12.htm">LarryK12</a>.</p>
<p>For anyone who's interested, this is the label on the reverse side of the unit:</p>

<p>The little LED on the front is red during charging, and turns green when finished. It's a decent unit, and a darn sight cheaper (it costs about $30) than a full-featured universal charger like the Triton 2 ($120 plus a DC PS, which is about $60).</p>
