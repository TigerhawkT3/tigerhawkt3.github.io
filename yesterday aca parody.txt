ACA... all insurance companies will pay
No denying coverage today
Oh, don't repeal the ACA.

Suddenly, House and Senate and Presidency
They will now vote inconsistently
The ACA may cease to be.

Why they voted "no," we all know; it's child's play.
They want it to last; can't lambast the ACA.

ACA... love the fact that I'm insured today.
Now I fear complacency will fade
Oh, why repeal the ACA.

Why they voted "no," we all know; it's child's play.
