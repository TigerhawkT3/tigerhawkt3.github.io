<p>Extech 411</p>
<p>The Extech 411 DMM is an extremely full-featured digital multimeter, with AC and DC voltage and current, diode testing, resistance, and temperature.</p>
<p><img src="images/4111.jpg" width="707" height="486" /></p>
<p>It comes with a red wire, a black wire, and a K-type temperature probe. I don't believe a 9V battery is included, and the battery compartment is secured with small screws. As you can see below, it has a handy stand that can double as a hanging hook, with detents at 0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 degrees.</p>

<p>The right-angle plugs go into the unit's ports, and the long ends are the test probes, which can be tucked into the rear of the unit.</p>

<p>I really don't know what else to say about this. It's versatile and handy, with other Extech products that can plug into and operate with it. I'm happy with it.</p>
