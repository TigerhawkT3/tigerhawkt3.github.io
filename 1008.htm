<p>Dorcy 41-1008</p>
<p>The Dorcy 41-1008 is the D-cell version of the <a href="1012.htm">1012</a>. It's more squat and stocky, and it's heavier (duh). Mine has a Nite-Ize PR LED in it. I've already used it on a night fishing trip, and it was fantastic, weathering a drop right on the bezel with only a few tiny cosmetic scuffs on an already-frosted area. It makes a great area light that you can just turn on and forget, without even worrying about batteries.</p>

<p>This light is under $5, just like the 4AA version (less than a dollar more). A Nite-Ize LED is about $8. That's a sub-$15 light that will prove itself time and again as a solid performer. </p>
