We're no strangers to World
Of Warcraft's rules, these pros and I
Get all the raid buffs in my little PuG
We've got a pool to see who's the first to die.

I just wanna know what devs are doing
Gotta know their future plans.

Chorus:[Never gonna gib you up
Never gonna nerf you down
Never gonna turn around with my keyboard
Never gonna let you die
Never gon' get baked or high
Never gonna scam or lie for purples.]

Bridge:[We've known these patch notes for so long
You wanna flame him but
You're banned if you say it
Inside we both know he's a big moron
We know this game and we're gonna math it.]

And if you ask devs what they're thinking
They'll tell you so much... and nothing.

[Chorus]

[Chorus]

(Oh, gib you up)
(Oh, gib you up)
(Oh)
Never gonna gib, never gonna gib
(Gib you up)
(Oh)
Never gonna gib, never gonna gib
(Gib you up)

[Bridge]

I just wanna outline my class vision
Gotta make blues underpstand.

[Chorus x3]
