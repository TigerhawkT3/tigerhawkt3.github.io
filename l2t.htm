<p>Fenix L2T</p>
<p>The L2T is a nice little light, compact and light enough to comfortably EDC. It's not much wider than the 2AA cells that power it, and only a bit longer.</p>

<p>As you can see, it comes with a decent holster. It only has a belt loop, however, instead of a clip, so you have to thread a belt all the way through the loop.</p>
<p>The tailcap and head can both be unscrewed. The idea is to leave the head in place and open the tail to change batteries.</p>

<p>The head of the L2T is very nice. If you tighten it all the way, it'll give about 2.5 hours of perfectly regulated light (according to <a href="www.flashlightreviews.com/index1.html">FR</a>), and if you loosen it just slightly, the output will drop, giving you a still-useful amount of light for about 15-20 hours. Both levels are current regulated - no flickering.</p>
<p>I &quot;pimped&quot; my L2T with a TIC (Tactical Impact Crown) from <a href="http://www.tadgear.com">TAD Gear</a>. It affects the outer fringes of the spillbeam, but doesn't really make much practical difference in the beam. However, it precludes bezel-down carry in the holster, so you'll have to carry it bezel-up.</p>

<p>This light uses 0.12A on low and 0.8A on high, at 2.3V, consuming 0.276W and 1.84W of power, respectively.</p>
<p>The L2T is a finely designed and produced light. It delivers great bang for the buck, with lots of bang indeed.</p>
