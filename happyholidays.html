<h1>Mi holiday es su holiday</h1>
<p>Wishing &ldquo;happy holidays&rdquo; around one holiday and no others is like waking up on your birthday and asking everyone what gifts they got.</p>
<p>Look, it&rsquo;s nice that you want to wish people well on their most important holidays. It really is. But could you do it with a modicum of effort and respect rather than just genericizing your own most important holiday? For the record, I don&rsquo;t mind being wished a Merry Christmas. Most people (in my country, the U.S.) are Christian, so it&rsquo;s a pretty safe bet that anyone you meet is likely Christian. The issue is with being wished &ldquo;happy holidays&rdquo; when <em>there are no other holidays at that time</em>, and those wishes stop as soon as Christmas is over.</p>
<p>I made a sort of infographic:</p>
<a href="images/happy_holidays_infographic.png"><img width=600 src="images/happy_holidays_infographic.png"/></a>
<h1>You failed because you tried</h1>
<p>If people didn&rsquo;t try to wish &ldquo;happy holidays&rdquo; in such a precise timeframe, it might have succeeded. Unfortunately, other holidays don&rsquo;t coincide precisely with Christmas, and the cutoffs for &ldquo;happy holidays&rdquo; are rather sharp. The only holidays I can guess that &ldquo;happy holidays&rdquo; was meant to include given the time of year are Christmas, Chanukah, and Kwanzaa. But Chanukah ended weeks ago this year, and &ldquo;happy holidays&rdquo; stops right after Christmas, which is when Kwanzaa begins.</p>
<p>While &ldquo;happy holidays&rdquo; pretends to be generic and open-minded, it really just assumes that other cultures also celebrate Christmas, but they don&rsquo;t call it &ldquo;Christmas,&rdquo; they call it a quarter-pounder. However, other cultures actually have their major holidays at various times of the year. Judaism has its major holidays in the spring (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover">Passover</a>) and late summer (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah">new year</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur">Yom Kippur</a>). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%E1%BA%BFt">Tết</a>, the Vietnamese new year, is in the spring. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan">Ramadan</a> is in the spring as well. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwanzaa">Kwanzaa</a>, an African-American celebration, runs from December 26 to January 1. Winter holidays get elevated to popularity just due to their proximity to Christmas. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah">Chanukah</a>, for example, gets much more mainstream attention than Judaism&rsquo;s actual major holidays, just because it&rsquo;s in the winter. The movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hebrew_Hammer"><em>The Hebrew Hammer</em></a> even makes a joke out of this, with the Jewish protagonist saving Chanukah and his mother dismissing his accomplishment with &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not even a high holiday.&rdquo;</p>
<h1>Land of ice and snow</h1>
<p>I want you to imagine you&rsquo;re not in the States, not in any country you know of &ndash; you live there and yet you feel like a stranger in a strange land. One day, trudging through icy slush and wishing you&rsquo;d worn your thicker gloves, a stranger smiles at you and calls out, &ldquo;happy holidays!&rdquo; Startled, you try to say both &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; and end up with something approaching &ldquo;helks,&rdquo; but it doesn&rsquo;t matter because you had no volume. Clearing your throat, you reply, &ldquo;you too!&rdquo; (Nailed it.) The stranger asks if you have any plans for the holiday. Um, no, not really... He looks at you aghast. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not spending the Leap Day with family? February 29th is in just a few days!&rdquo; You explain that, in your culture, that&rsquo;s just a number on a calendar, not a holiday. &ldquo;Oh, I see! Are you American? (You nod.) Well, don&rsquo;t you do anything for the American holiday season?&rdquo; After you stand there glassy-eyed for several moments, he prompts you with &ldquo;you know, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day">Groundhog Day</a>.&rdquo; Which, of course, is on February 2nd and by this point probably owes most of its fame to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)">classic movie</a>.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bASvwP2U_m8">observe Krusty the Clown delivering holiday wishes</a> with &ldquo;have a Merry Christmas, Happy Chanukah, Kwazy Kwanzaa, a tip-top Tết, and a solemn, dignified Ramadan.&rdquo; Ironically, he&rsquo;s gone to all this effort for the holiday his audience cares about, a holiday he cares about but that ended on December 11 (this was &ldquo;Grift of the Magi,&rdquo; s11e09, airing 12/19/1999), a holiday that was upcoming but would abruptly cease to get even spillover attention on the day it started, and two holidays in the spring.</p>
<h1>It could be worse, of course</h1>
<p>I have seen and heard several people swear up and down with absolute certainty that everyone celebrates Christmas. I tell them that e.g. Jewish people don&rsquo;t, and the reply is &ldquo;yes they do.&rdquo; That is a separate problem.</p>
<p>TL;DR: If you mean &ldquo;Merry Christmas,&rdquo; say &ldquo;Merry Christmas.&rdquo; Saying &ldquo;happy holidays&rdquo; when it&rsquo;s clearly only relevant to one specific holiday makes it a shallow, hollow gesture.</p>
