Write a simple console-based game of rock-paper-scissors in Python. The user plays against the computer. The computer's choice is a simple random selection. Therefore, the outcome of this game is an equal chance of the user winning, the user losing, or a tie. Assume the player knows how the game works.

Assistant:

```python
import random

# Define the rock, paper, and scissors symbols
rock = "\u2611"
paper = "\u2613"
scissors = "\u2617"

# Define the play function
def play():
    # Choose a random symbol
    choice = random.choice([rock, paper, scissors])

    # Print the choice to the console
    print(f"You choose: {choice}")

    # Compare the choices and determine the winner
    if choice == rock and opponent == paper:
        return "Computer wins!"
    elif choice == paper and opponent == rock:
        return "You win!"
    elif choice == scissors and opponent == rock:
        return "You win!"
    elif choice == rock and opponent == scissors:
        return "Computer wins!"
    elif choice == paper and opponent == scissors:
        return "You win!"
    elif choice == scissors and opponent == paper:
        return "Computer wins!"
    else:
        return "Tie"

# Define the main game loop
def main():
    # Set the computer's random choice
    computer_choice = random.choice([rock, paper, scissors])

    # Play the game and print the outcome
    result = play()
    print(f"The result is: {result}")

# Call the play function and start the game
play()
main()
