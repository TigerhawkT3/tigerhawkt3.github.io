<p>Fenix L0P-SE</p>
<p>The L0P-SE is a wonderful EDC keychain light. It's multi-level (albeit PWM), small, and has good runtime on the low level while still having big output on high.</p>

<p>This Fenix makes a great gift, as it comes in a nice gift box. I actually have given it as a gift, and I think my cousin liked it, I hope.</p>

<p>Inside the box is a foam insert that holds the light and its accessories. The split ring and lobster claw do not come preinstalled.</p>

<p>This light is the same size and appearance as the <a href="e1.htm">E1</a>. However, it uses an R-bin LuxI instead of a Nichia Power LED, and the result is quite excellent. The beam is smooth and white. It's more of a thrower than a flooder, however, so it might fall short of some EDC tasks. Its other features more than make up for this shortcoming, though.</p>

<p>When you first turn it on, the L0P-SE is in Medium. To get to Low, turn it off and then right back on again. To get to High, repeat. If you leave the light off for more than a second and a half, the light will start in Medium again the next time it's turned on.</p>
<p><img src="images/l0pse4.jpg" width="866" height="188" /></p>
<p>The light uses 0.14A on Low, 0.3A on Medium, and 0.9A on High, all at 1.3V from an Energizer L92 AAA lithium, consuming 0.182W, 0.39W, and 1.17W, respectively.</p>
<p>The PWM is pretty severe, unfortunately.</p>
<p>This light can tailstand like the E0 and E1.</p>

<p>The Fenix L0P-SE is good, but obsolete, with newer, brighter, more versatile lights already available.</p>
