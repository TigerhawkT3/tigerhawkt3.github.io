<p>The M10 is a beautiful piece on engineering, well-designed and well-machined. It's a dual-output CR123A pocket light, with a narrow and a wide optic available. The M10i comes with both optics.</p>
<p><img src="images/m10i1.jpg" width="651" height="238" /></p>
<p>In the picture above, you can see the bezel on the left, followed by the cooling fins, body, and lanyard groove.</p>
<p>This light can operate at either 400mA or 1000mA, and can accept either of two optics (wide and narrow). To change the output level:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Remove the head.</li>
  <li>Find the hole in the threads.</li>
  <li>Using a toothpick or tweezers (like those found on an ordinary SAK), reach under the threads through the bottom of the head.</li>
  <li>Move a tiny switch to change levels. It should be visible through the hole.</li>
  <li>I don't remember which position is high or low, so consult your manual.</li>
</ol>
<p>To change out the optic:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Remove the head.</li>
  <li>Grasp the bezel and threads in old rags, and unscrew.</li>
  <li>Let the old optic fall onto a soft cloth. Be careful with the glass window.</li>
  <li>Handling it by the edges, pick up the new optic and place it where the old one was.</li>
  <li>Screw everything back together.</li>
</ol>

<p>I personally can't tell the difference between high and low, but I think I could if I could compare the two side by side. Low will last longer and high will make the light quite hot, but you'll get pretty flat output from both.</p>
<p>The optics, however, are a different matter. The narrow optic provides a mostly <a href="p1.htm">P1</a>-like beam, with great throw and spill. The wide optic, which I prefer due to the rarity of a good flooder, makes a wide flood similar to that of a diffused <a href="gladius.htm">Gladius</a> - no hotspot whatsoever.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful, reliable light, and I highly recommend it.</p>
