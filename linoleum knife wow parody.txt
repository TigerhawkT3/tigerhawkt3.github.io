Don't lawl, pot!
Don't lawl, pot!
You queued here, run it.
Too shitfaced? Drop out!
We still have two competent CC!

Do not whine, bitch, or complain about my tanking style
I am tanking here! I kill all the mobs at once, and you will eat my dust
If you RP here, I will pop all my cooldowns and focus on you
When you get MCed

Do not explain the strat
If it's their first time here, then they should not be here!
Your health bar is now our health bar
And we will spend it on trash

Do not tell our guild healer where to stand
Don't keyboard turn out of fire
Or I'll ignore your debuff
When you get a disease

Did you bring your tank pet?
Pets shouldn't tank this!
Put the bear away
Leave it in the stable
Abandon it after the run

If I see you flat-out ignoring kill order,
Blizzard will ban your account for a decade
And delete your characters and turn your epics to greys
If I find you bought it on eBay,
I will log onto your realm, and tear your rep in half!
