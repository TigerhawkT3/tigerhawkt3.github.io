<p>Audio Indicator EXL-450</p>
<p>(Saftey first! Wear ear protection when working with noise.) </p>
<p>These are similar to the <a href="superbuzzer.htm">Super Buzzer</a>, but they're slightly smaller, weaker, and higher-pitched. They can produce 80dB at one meter at 18.9V and just SIX mA! That's about an 80-hour runtime on a pair of series-connected 9V batts. Heck, you'd be fine even with a stack of button cells! Neat.</p>

<p>As you can see, they're pretty compact. They're a buck or two each, so feel free to stock up. Try not to annoy your neighbors too much.</p>
