<p>Helping Hands</p>
<p>Guess what it's for. Come on, take a shot.</p>

<p>Yep, that's right - it holds stuff in place with posable alligator clips. Good for soldering, and other stuff too, I guess. It really beats holding hot things with your fingers, &quot;hands&quot; down!</p>
<p>There are versions available with magnifying lenses, iron holders, and other whatnot, but mine is a plain version. It's still &quot;handy,&quot; though!</p>
<p>These are a really clever idea - let's give a big &quot;hand&quot; to their inventor!</p>
<p>Okay, sorry about all the puns. I got carried away. The bottom line, though, is that if you solder things, you should get a pair of Helping Hands, because they're so useful and only cost about $5.</p>
