This is the highest-damage mage in the world... tribute.

Three runs ago, my LFD party and I...
We was steamrollin' through some long and boring PuGs.
And then LFD
Gave us a fiery fire mage
As a random group member.

And he said:
"I'm the top mage in the world,
So don't make me lol." (lols)

Well they and I, we /telled to each other
And we agreed,
"No way."

And we tried our hardest to play at our best
We just so happened to beat
The best mage in the world
We beat the best mage in the world.

Rawr our group makeup and the data you'll see
Rogue and pal make two
They and heals make three
And four, counting me.

Every over nine thousand runs or so
When the tank doth brang and the heal's hands glow
And the deeps don't blow, oh.

Needless to say,
The PuG QQ'ed.
Gave flak with his backlit keyboard
And the mage was pwned.
He asked us,
"(ffffuuuuu) Be you botters?"
And we said "Hey,"
"Don't feel bad, man."
Ha!
Lawwwaaawwwwl, lawwlawwlawwl
Lol lol, lo-ol, oh lolo-lolo-lol.

He was not the greatest deeps in the world, no
This is just his tribute.
We shrank his epeen, the greatest mage in the world, heh.
No!
He was pretty good, though
"I'm the greatest mage in the world!"
Yeah, right
I think the greatest mage in the world
Would Sheep.
But he never tried Polymorphing moon
The greatest mage in the world
Lawl, right.

Deeps it was time for mad deeps
We were uber-pwnage; the uber-pwnage, were we!
Forty k deeps, and you should have seen our heeps!
Pounding cooldowns, we fucking burned that place down
...With his help.

And the by far sweetest part is this, pwnies,
The run we ran on that rainy day...
It doesn't usually go nearly that well - we bomb!

This is just a tribute
I hardly believed it
And I wish I had Fraps'ed it
Just a matter of mad leet skillz.
Or luck!
Good mods, and addons,
We tell our lies and find they've turned truthful now
He went fire, and his Pyros went POW
Ran that whole dungeon with utter nooooobs
All right
Great fights.
