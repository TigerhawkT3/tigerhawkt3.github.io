<p>Strait-Line Sonic Laser Tape</p>
<p>This here is a fascinating little gadget. It measures distances between 1.5 feet and 50 feet using a &quot;sonar&quot; method. Press the &quot;Read&quot; button, and it'll emit a short click, measuring the distance and displaying it on the LCD. It can use multiple length units, measures length, area, or volume, and is a darn sight handier than a regular tape measure, especially if you're by yourself. Just set the base at one end of whatever you want to measure, and press the &quot;Read&quot; button. It includes the length of the unit in its measurements. A laser is automatically activated to help you aim.</p>

<p>This unit operates at 8.1V, using 0.2mA (1.62mW) when simply displaying the last measurement, and using 14.6mA (118.26mA) when making a measurement. Long, long battery life.</p>

<p>Below is the sonic emitter (sounds cool, doesn't it?).</p>

<p>There's a slide-out belt clip built in.</p>

<p>There are some drawbacks to this device: the target surface must be reasonably smooth to reflect the sound back, and it must also be nearly perpendicular to the unit, also to reflect the sound back. At $30-40, it's more expensive than an analog tool, but it's cooler.</p>
