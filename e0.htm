<p>Fenix E0</p>
<p>The E0 is pretty direct competition for the revered ARC AAA-P. Here is a short list of differences:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The E0 is regulated for 8 hours on alk and 12 hours on an Energizer L92. The ARC is semi-regulated.</li>
  <li>The ARC starts out significantly brighter than the E0, becoming dimmer at about 0.5-1 hour in.</li>
  <li>The ARC has many devoted users, since it was the first light of its kind. It holds a special place in the heart of CPF.</li>
  <li>The ARC's HA is much better than that of the Fenix. </li>
  <li>The ARC costs twice as much as the E0.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's about all I can think of.</p>
<p>First, the E0 is tiny. Really, really tiny.</p>

<p>That picture doesn't really give a good idea of scale, so here's another picture, this time with the light open and an L92 AAA sticking out.</p>

<p>See? Tiny.</p>
<p>The E0 doesn't have much output, but it's definitely more than enough to accomplish its intended purpose, which is lighting up dark corners indoors and lighting up a path for basic navigation. It's a great EDC light. Its floody output is pretty bluish, but if you need exact color definition to figure out which wire is greenish-blue and which is bluish-green to save the city from certain destruction, you'll most likely have more and better lights.</p>
<p>It's a 5mm LED sitting inside a V-shaped, bare Al reflector. And yes, it does indeed reflect, even though it's bare Al. There is no window covering, but the LED is recessed.</p>

<p>There's a split ring included with the light, and a notch in the tail lets the light tailstand.</p>

<p>The E0 draws a mere 0.09A at 1.6V, on an Energizer L92 AAA lithium, consuming 0.144W of power.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a great light. Whenever I need a penlight-type light, I reach for the E0, because it's unbelievably small and light, the output is decent and useful, and the runtime is unbelievable. For only $20, this light is a real bargain.</p>
