<p>Lumapower Lumacraft D-Mini</p>
<p>The D-Mini is an excellent little light, and Lumapower deserves every accolade it's inspired. It has a great design, with snazzy looks, easy operation, and very useful throw (to put it mildly), and great fit/finish quality; all the parts fit together smoothly, with no bad spots, lint in the head, etc. It's quite a pocketable light, although it's far from keychain-light (P1) status. It's barely noticable on the holster, but that doesn't mean much coming from me because I also carry an Inka, my wallet, my <a href="gladius.htm">Gladius</a>+<a href="fm34.htm">FM34</a>, my phone, my SOG B61, and an FT-01XSE P4 on my belt. Still, it's small.</p>

<p>As you can see by the sliver of the tailswitch button peeking out from the tailcap, it can't tailstand. That's not really where this light &quot;shines&quot; (ha, ha), but it would be a nice feature.</p>
<p>It runs on a single 16340, either primary or Li-Ion. It supposedly gets a nicely visible increase in brightness on RCRs, so I'll probably buy a couple cells from AW at some point to try that out.</p>

<p>The light comes with a tactical-type push-momentary/twist-constant installed, and a reverse clickie is included, along with a black tailswitch cover (installed) and a GITD tailswitch cover (included). I immediately swapped out the tactical switch and black switch cover for the reverse clickie and GITD. It's much easier to use, in my opinion.</p>

<p>The GITD material is decent. Hit it with a blast (not more than a second or two) from another flashlight, and it'll be really bright for a few minutes. It fades to a merely reasonable glow for a while after that. The photo below is about what you should expect a minute or two after a charge. It isn't powerful enough to use as a floody flashlight, but it's enough for it to be visible. Click that faintly glowing button, and you'll get a whole ton of light out the other end.</p>

<p>Now, then, &quot;D-Mini&quot; may have made you think of a small light, and that's accurate, but this light really, and I mean REALLY, stands out in the throw department. That big head is there for a reason!</p>

<p>This thing is insane. Here are a couple comparison shots:</p>
<p>P1 vs. D-Mini:<br />

<p>Crazy.</p>

<p>All in all, this is a great piece of work - very functional, and at the same a pleasure to use. It was great to have during one of the many instances in which, while leaving a friend's house at night, their black lab rushed out the door to sniff around. He only goes a few houses down in a cul-de-sac, but it sure felt good to whip out the D-Mini and light him up so we could go after him and shoo him back indoors. The D-Mini has proven itself to be an eminently useful and impressive light, for about $60. Congratulations, Lumapower!</p>
