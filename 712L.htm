<p>FavourLight (Nuwai) HLX-712L</p>
<p>Thisis one sweet headlight. If you buy it from AmondoTech, you can get it for $27.50+shipping, and if you do a search on &quot;712L,&quot; you'll see a result that offers eight (8) extra Titanium lithiums for free! In addition, it already comes with a pair of Duracell lithiums in the package.</p>

<p>As you can see, the cells are held vertically behind the LA. The light's electronics are directly behind the LA, with the cells on either side.</p>
<p>This headlight is very similar to the Argo HP, with a few exceptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It's quieter.</li>
  <li>There are three levels (Low&gt;Med&gt;High).</li>
  <li>There's a flasher mode.</li>
  <li>The beam is greener (on this particular unit).</li>
  <li>The battery carrier is worlds easier to access.</li>
  <li>It's significantly less expensive. </li>
</ul>

<p>An Argo HP runs about $45. This headlight is less than $30+shipping, and comes with eight extra cells. I liked this headlight so much, I bought two more! They're still in the package, but next time I go camping or something, I'll be sure to bring them along. I've said many times that a headlamp is invaluable because it frees up both hands, letting you cook, pitch a tent, or carry a large object. After wearing one for a few minutes, you'll wonder how you could have functioned without one.</p>
<p>This headlight pulls 0.26A on high, 0.13A on medium, and 0.06A on low mode at 5.6V, for 1.456W, 0.728W, and 0.336W of power consumption, respectively. </p>
<p>This headlight offers simply enormous bang for the buck. If you need a great headlight on a tight budget, get this one. </p>
