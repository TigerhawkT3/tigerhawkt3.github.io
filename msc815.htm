<p>Lenmar Mach Speed Charger MSC815</p>
<p>The MSC is a 15-minute NiMH charger that can charge AA and AAA cells individually. It can charge a pair of Lenmar's high-current Pro-H AA cells in as little as 8 minutes. It includes two, but you don't have to use them if you don't want to.</p>
<p>The beauty of such a fast charger (as opposed to units that take 1-14 hours) is that it really minimizes the downside of ordinary NiMHs, which is their high self-discharge. It used to be that if you needed charged cells for a short trip or something, you would have to remember it the night before, which is pretty difficult for most people. Pop a few cells in this thing, however, and you'll have juiced-up cells in 10-15 minutes. It supposedly won't be a 100% charge (more like 90-95%);  if you let the cells sit in the charger after the rapid charge is done, it'll switch to a trickle charge to finish up the cells. However, when I ZTS cells that have just finished a quick charge, they register at the 100% mark, so I figure they're pretty full.</p>
<p>As you can see in the photo below, it comes with both AC and DC cables. The AC one has a long cable with a converter brick in the middle. Also note how each adapter is actually LABELED by the manufacturer: the AC brick clearly says &quot;LENMAR&quot; and the DC plug says &quot;MSC8-DC,&quot; which means the Mach Speed Charger 8-minute DC adapter. If you have a mountain of adapters jumbled together and you haven't yet had the idea to label each of them (&quot;no problem, I'll just remember which goes where&quot; - that doesn't fool anyone), that clear lettering is a beautiful thing to see. </p>

<p>As mentioned above, this charger has four individual AA/AAA NiMH charging channels. There's an LED below each channel to indicate that the channel is in quick charge mode. It'll turn off when the charger detects a reasonably full cell, at which point it'll trickle-charge that cell. It is important to be aware that charging begins a few seconds after you plug the unit in; this is normal. Load the cells, plug a cable to a power source, then connect the cable to the port on top of the unit. A few seconds later, the LEDs will light up and the fan will spin. If you can, it's probably a good idea (as always) to direct an additional fan at the unit so that the cells are cooler and happier.</p>

<p>You can faintly see the unit's fan blades behind the grey plastic grill. It's not exactly whisper-quiet, but it's about 10dB at 1', which is around 3dB at 1m.</p>

<p>All in all, this is a great charger that'll help you realize the full potential of all those NiMHs you have sitting around. At $30 for the charger, AC and DC cords, and a pair of high-current Pro-H AA cells, it's a bargain. Please note, however, that I have  tried neither Energizer nor Duracell's 15-minute chargers. I don't know what they come with or how they perform, but chances are they'll be just as good, so pick one and enjoy.</p>
