<p>Streamlight ProPolymer 3C Luxeon</p>
<p>The ProPoly 3C Lux is like a beefed-up or &quot;mega&quot; version of the 4AA. Everything in this light is bigger and better than in the 4AA.</p>
<p><img src="images/slppl3c1.jpg" width="694" height="372" /></p>
<p>Differences that set the 3C apart from the 4AA:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Brighter</li>
  <li>More runtime</li>
  <li>3 inline C</li>
  <li>LA sits firmly in (but can be removed from) bezel</li>
  <li>Circular body</li>
  <li>Belt clip</li>
  <li>No tailstand</li>
  </ul>
<p><img src="images/slppl3c2.jpg" width="533" height="518" /></p>
<p>The belt clip is really excellent, as it's a clip instead of a loop, has a tail for easy opening, and has a hole in the tail for hanging.</p>
<p>Other than the above differences, the 3C is the spitting image of the 4AA.</p>

<p>That white plastic piece in the above photo provides polarity protection. However, the button tops of some cells, like Amondotech's Titanium C NiMHs, are too large to get through the opening and make contact. This can be solved by putting one of those tiny magnets (the kind that come with Li-Ion cells) on the cathode of the topmost cell. The little magnet fits through the polarity protection piece and allows the circuit to close.</p>
<p>This light draws 0.7A at 4.4V, using 3.08W of power.</p>
<p>Get one of these. Right now.  </p>
