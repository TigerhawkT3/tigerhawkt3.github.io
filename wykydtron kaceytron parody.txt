In the year two thousand eight plus five, Kaceytron came to life
Born of no specific design, to troll and waste our time
A sinister intelligence, mimicking a whore
When her poor team will lose MMR as she feeds.

Views are free, chat costs gold, because virgins lack self-control
Matches streamed, infecting the world
Charging tolls (they're not worth), feeding mid until it gets old
With an ease that's born of ads and lies.

Brains turned to mush
With their hopes she'll toy
Manipulating lonely nerds.

Her coffers filled
A bulging purse
Her act is loud - you'll fear her name.

Hey, it's the Kaceytron
It's the Kaceytron
Hey it's the Kaceytron
Oh no!

Hey, it's the Kaceytron
It's the Kaceytron
Hey it's the Kaceytron
Oh no!

Hey, it's the Kaceytron
It's the Kaceytron
Hey it's the Kaceytron
Oh no!

Hey, it's the Kaceytron
It's the Kaceytron
Hey it's the Kaceytron
Oh no!

The gauntlet thrown, engulfed by dirt
Feel the hatred, she treats teammates all like flies.

Humanity is doomed.

With our fears taken form and voice, a future we can't face
The playerbase, of hope bereft, I fear may be too late
Dodging is the only way to avoid Kaceytron
Elo fried, pray for patience, time will tell.

Trolls, they feel no pain, as real players cry
This is the end of the playerbase
Devastation will burn
Our ashes floating to the skies.

With hormones
We fooled ourselves
A crime to click "Donate."

Hey, it's the Kaceytron
It's the Kaceytron
Hey it's the Kaceytron
Oh no!

Hey, it's the Kaceytron
It's the Kaceytron
Hey it's the Kaceytron
Oh no!

Hey, it's the Kaceytron
It's the Kaceytron
Hey it's the Kaceytron
Oh no!

Hey, it's the Kaceytron
It's the Kaceytron
Hey it's the Kaceytron.
