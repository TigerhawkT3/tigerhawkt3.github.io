<p>Fenix P1</p>
<p>The Fenix P1 is the quintessential no-frills pocket rocket. It puts out a beautiful, bright, useful beam for two hours, then dims. I carried one on my keychain for a few months, and it served me well.</p>

<p>Fenix anodizing (on black finishes, at least) isn't really up to snuff, as you can see in the following picture.</p>

<p>However, it's still a beautifully functional light. It can get pretty hot with little delay, so be careful of giving this light to non-flashaholics. Also, try not to use the tailstand feature for too long, as this light relies on your hand to provide a bloodstream heatpump to keep it cool. Remember though - it's bright!</p>
<p>It pulls 0.78A at 2.6V, for 2.028W of power consumption.</p>
<p>The P1 was a great light when released, and it remains such, but it's obsolete, overshadowed by brighter and better lights.  </p>
