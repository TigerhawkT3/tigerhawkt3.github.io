<p>Silencio Original Earmuff Hearing Protector RBW-71</p>
<p>Because of all the noisemakers I've assembled, I saw fit to invest in a pair of earmuffs for my friend who sometimes likes to see (hear) the things in action.</p>
<p><img src="images/silencio1.jpg" width="545" height="587" /></p>
<p>These are non-electronic shooter's muffs, with a noise reduction rating (NRR) of 25dB.</p>

<p>I've tried these, and I don't think they're nearly as comfortable as the <a href="leightning.htm">Leightnings</a>, but they're not bad at all.</p>
<p>Everyone in the vicinity of loud noises should have ear protection.</p>
